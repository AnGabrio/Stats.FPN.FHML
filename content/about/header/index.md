The Statistical Expertise and Research Group is a research group based in the Department of Methodology and Statistics in the Faculties of [Psychology and Neuroscience](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-psychology-and-neuroscience) and [Health Medicine and Life Sciences](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-health-medicine-and-life-sciences) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/). 
Our activity revolves around the development and application of statistical methodology for the analysis of health-related analyses and research fields, e.g. survey design and methodology, high frequency longitudinal data or cost-effectiveness analysis. In addition to research and statistical advice on specific topics, we produce several research articles and relevant pieces of software.
