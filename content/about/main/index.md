  We work in close collaboration with academics both within FPN and FHML, as well as across the whole UM and at other institutions, including [Univesity College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) (UK) among others, internationally. This creates exciting opportunities to develop new methodologies for problems that are relevant to real, practical applications in many different research fields that involve statistics as a key component in their data analysis tasks.
  
  We are directly involved in the organisation and management of different UM BSc and MSc Programmes involving statistical modules and elements, from standard statstical methodology (e.g. hypothesis testing and linear regression) to more advanced techniques (e.g. multilevel and survival analysis). We contribute in core teaching as well as in related research activities, thus providing close links with other FPN and FHML departments and research groups (e.g. the [Health Services Research group](https://hsr.mumc.maastrichtuniversity.nl/health-services-research-hsr)).
